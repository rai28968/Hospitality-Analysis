# 🏨 AtliQ Grands - Hotel Analytics Dashboard (Power BI Project)

## 📌 Project Overview

**AtliQ Grands** is a five-star hotel chain operating across India for over 20 years. Recently, the company faced a decline in market share and revenue due to increased competition and ineffective decision-making.

To overcome this, the management aimed to implement **Business and Data Intelligence** practices. However, they lacked an internal analytics team and thus hired external help (that’s me!) to provide data-driven insights from historical data using Power BI.
